|Notes| Score | Evidence |
|-----| --------- | --------- |
|Video1|    |    |
|Bonus: Xfold improvement|  |  |
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation)| |    |
|Use of style checkers|  |  |
|Use of code formatters.|  |  |
|Use of syntax checkers.|  |   |
|Use of code coverage|  |   |
|Other automated analysis tools|  |   |
|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others... |  |   |
|but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot) |    |    |
|Number of commits|  |  |
|Number of commits: by different people|  |   |
|Issues reports: there are many|  |    |
|Issues are being closed|  |  |
|DOI badge: exists |  |  |
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly |  |  |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z |  |  |
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing |  |  |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|    |    |
|Use of version control tools|  |  |
|Test cases exist|  |    |
|Test cases are routinely executed|  |  |
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|  |   |
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|  |  |
|Chat channel: exists|    |    |
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|  |  |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|  |   |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|  |  |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|  |   |
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|  | |
|Short release cycles |  |  |
